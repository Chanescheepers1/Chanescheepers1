### 🩺 About Me
- 🧠 I fix humans (under supervision, sadly).
- 💻 I write code (mostly to delay fixing humans).
- ☕ I run on caffeine and blind optimism.
- 📍 Based in South Africa. Currently based in my study cave.

> "Neither comes with a manual.  
> Success rate: negotiable."  
> – me, during ward rounds *and* Git commits
